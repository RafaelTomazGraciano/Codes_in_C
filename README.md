## Overview

This repository contains a collection of C programming examples and exercises based on the book "Linguagem C - Completa e Descomplicada" (2ª edition) by André Backes. The code samples are organized by programming concepts, providing a comprehensive resource for learning C programming from basic to advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

- **1.Conditions**: Examples of conditional statements in C (if, else, switch)
- **2.Loop**: Various loop implementations (while, do-while, for)
- **3.Array && Matrix**: Working with arrays and matrices
- **4.String**: String manipulation examples
- **5.Function**: Function definitions and usage
- **6.Pointers**: Pointer concepts and applications
- **7.struct & enum & union & typedef**: User-defined data types
- **8.Memory Allocation**: Dynamic memory allocation examples
- **9.Archives**: File handling operations
- **Games**: Simple games implemented in C

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run these examples, you need:

- A C compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic understanding of command-line operations

### Compiling and Running

To compile a C program, use:

```bash
gcc -o program_name file_name.c
```

To run the compiled program:

```bash
./program_name  # On Unix/Linux/macOS
program_name.exe  # On Windows
```

## Examples

### Conditions Example

The repository includes programs demonstrating conditional logic, such as temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### Games

Simple text-based games implemented in C, including a number guessing game where the player has three attempts to guess a number between 1 and 10.

## Learning Path

The repository is organized to follow a progressive learning path:

1. Start with basic conditions and loops
2. Move to data structures (arrays, matrices, strings)
3. Learn functions and pointers
4. Explore complex data types and memory management
5. Practice with file operations
6. Apply knowledge in simple game development
